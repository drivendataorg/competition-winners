## Background

DrivenData runs machine learning competitions to help non-profits, NGOs, governments, and other social impact organizations use data science in service of humanity. Part of DrivenData's mission is to enable data scientists and non-profits to learn from the work that is done in these competitions. To this end, the code submitted by winners is released under an open source license for others to learn from, use, and adapt.

## What's in this Repository
This repository contains code prodvided by the winners of [competitions](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/) hosted on DrivenData. Feel free to browse to any particular competition's winning repository or just clone all of the winning code to learn from!

## Cloning this repository

Note that when any repo containing submodules is cloned, each submodule needs to be initialized else they remain empty.

To avoid explicitly initializing each submodule, use the `--recursive` flag when cloning:

`git clone --recursive https://github.com/drivendata/competition-winners.git`.

This will download the `competition-winners` repository, as well as the contents of _every_ submodule in the winners repository.
